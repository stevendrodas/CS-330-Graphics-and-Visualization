# CS-330-Graphics-and-Visualization
CS-330 Computer Graphics and Visualization course. Final project -> Rendering an original 3D scene

<h3> How do I approach designing software?</h3>
One of the more important skills that were reiterated throughout this course, that I have learned in both this course and previous courses at SNHU, was learning how to utilize encapsulation, abstraction, and implementing modularity to my code base. For example, through using the SceneManager, I was better able to utilize custom functions that enhanced modularity, organization, and maintainability throughout my code. Within these functions included constructor and destructor functions that managed initialization and cleanup duties that otherwise would have required redundant code blocks throughout the code base without this implementation. As a result, my approach to designing this 3D scene through encapsulation makes the class reusable throughout the project and enables me or any other developer to easily maintain the code. 

<h3> How do I approach developing a program?</h3>
Through working iteratively as we were instructed throughout the course, I was able to learn the value of iteratively working through different parts of the overall project one by one, focusing on specific elements of the code, without cramming in all the work at once and risking the chance of developing unreadable and unmaintainable code. This is useful for all routes of development since working iteratively through industry practices such as Agile Development are rampant across all different types of projects and applications.

<h3> How can computer science help me in reaching my goals, specifically this course?</h3>
This course was exciting to delve into and provided me with an opening perspective on the world of computer graphics and visualization. During the course and throughout my development, I was better able to appreciate the work that goes behind top of the line video game graphics and the dedication needed to complete such projects. Through this course I have now considered potentially digging deeper into the world of video games and graphics, which could one day be extremely valuable for me if I decide to work within the gaming industry.
